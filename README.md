# Cheatsheet for Testing React application with Testing Library

TBD

<!-- A cheatsheet to accessing elements on a web app.

> packages helps you test UI components in a user-centric way

Because of how Testing Library encourages us to test based on what user expects, it forces us to write semantic HTML.

instead of using <command>ByTestId which will require a corresponding declaration of data-testid on the element, use inherent role of the respective html elements. this will encourage us to write semantic HTML.

-   [`<input>`](./src/components/Input)
